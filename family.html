</p>
<p>This is my wife, Shona. She is very wonderful. I like hanging around her. She is a teacher at Gabriel Dumont. She teaches mathematics and sciences to children in grade 7 to 8.</p>

<p>We moved to London, in October 2014. We had met each other in Nepal when she was on a mission's trip in 2009. Soon after that we grew closer and decided to get married in 2011. We actually got married in August 2013 in Kathmandu, Nepal.

<p>We had an addition to our family last November 2015. Our first child "Stefan" was born into the family. He is a very cute baby. Everyone who sees him or meets him starts ooh-ing and ah-ing over him. We love him very much.We hope and pray that we will be good parents to him. </p>
