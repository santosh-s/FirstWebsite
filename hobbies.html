<p>I love travelling to new places, getting to know new people, new food and spices, new culture. I am always amazed to see different people and the contrasts in lifestyles. The thing which may be wrong in one's eyes in one community is considered good in other community.  </p>

<p><img src="images/travel.jpg" alt="my photo hobby1" /><br/>Recently, I visited <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en.html"/><span class="nepal">Chicago</span></a>, a city of skyscrapers, a very beautiful entertaining place which was just about five hours drive from London, Ontario. We were actually driving to Copper Mountain, Colorado to do some mountain climbing with a friend of mine. He is a professional mountain climber. He has already attempted climbing Mount Everest twice. His name is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alanarnette.com/blog/2013/03/20/everest-2013-interview-with-robert-kay-nepal-connections/"/><span class="nepal">Robert Kay</span></a>. At present he is on his third attempt to climb <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/robert.kay.58?fref=nf"><span class="nepal">Everest</span></a>. I hope and pray he will be successful this time.</p>

<p>I have climbed a few smaller mountains in my own country. A few years ago, I climbed to the base camp of Annapurna Mountain. It takes one about 3 days to get there. I took my wife a longer route and made it to the base camp in 6 days. They were memorable moments for both of us. </p>
